Hi! I'm Teruo, a husband, pet father and software engineer passionate about building thoughtful, user-friendly experiences on the web. I enjoy working on creative projects, learning new technologies, and sharing what I discover along the way.

This site is a place where I showcase my work, write about things that interest me, and experiment with new ideas. Thanks for stopping by!
